#Data-Dome-Interface

This is a full stack solution for migrating an unstructured hierarchy data and storing them in a database and expose an API to interact with the data and visualizing the hierarchy tree from the hierarchy data stored in the database.

This repository consists of 3 modules as mentioned below :-

1. Migration : Responsible for storing data to database
2. Backend : Exposes an API to interact with hierarchy data
3. Frontend : Visualizes the hierarchy tree with details of each node.

Improvements :-
*Repository can be made more modularized to utilize components which are used are often.
*There were issues with Node version and ES6 modules. This can be worked upon with more configuration to utilize ES6 syntax better.
*Better transformation logic and data structures usage can optimize performance for large data sets.
*Graph database can be used to utilize its capabilities for large data sets.
